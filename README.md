# Train-Scheduler

Conclusion:


Overall this assignment was not too difficult to complete... thanks the the classwork activities(employee Sheet). Having not worked with databases at all, it was a challenge at first, but I was quickly able to grasp the concepts of firebase. I would have liked to have spent more time on this assignment, but because of the importance of our first projects, I finished this ASAP to devote my time towards that. Overall I put about 5hrs into this assignment.




Pseudo Code:

Create basic HTML/CSS.

Setup and initialize the firebase.

Creat onclick function to add trains with their schedules.
    Create firebase ref to store the info in the database.
    Retreive database values and display on website.

Use momemt to create the time values and display on website.
